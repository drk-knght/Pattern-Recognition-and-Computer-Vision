Code Editor: VS Code

Instructions to compile and run the project:

1. Open terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.
2. Run the command: `mkdir build`
3. Run the command: `cd build`
4. Run the command: `cmake ..`
5. Run the command: `make`

The build process will create three executables:

1. Camera Calibration:

   ```bash
   ./calibration [path_to_image_or_video]
   ```

   If no path is provided, it will use the default camera (webcam).

2. Pose Estimation:

   ```bash
   ./pose_estimator [path_to_image_or_video]
   ```

   If no path is provided, it will use the default camera (webcam).

3. Feature Detection:
   ```bash
   ./feature_detector
   ```
   This uses the default camera for real-time feature detection.

Note: For calibration and pose estimation, the program expects a 9x6 checkerboard pattern. The pose estimator requires calibration data to be present before running.
