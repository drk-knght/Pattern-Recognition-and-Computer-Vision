Operation System: macOS 15.3.1
Code Editor: VS Code

Instruction to compile and run the project (and extensions):

1. Open terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.
2. Run the command: `mkdir build`
3. Run the command: `cd build`
4. Run the command: `cmake ..`
5. Run the command: `make`
6. Run the command: `./<executable_name> --dir <path_to_image_directory> [--train] [--classify]`

Example: `./object_recognition --dir ./images --train`

Note: The executable name is `object_recognition` for the first eight parts and multi object detection, `object_recognition_custom_knn` for the ninth part (we implemented KNN classifier with k=2), and `object_recognition_ext` has custom logic for three of the 1-4 tasks of the assignment (custom threshold algorithm, custom erosion algorithm, and segmentation algorithm).
